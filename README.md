# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

## Why?

I was given the task to make sure this code was more accessible while maintaining the intent and design of the current website. 


## What Was Done

I adjusted all the HTML codes to to have individual semantic code.

The flow of the elements in the HTML was already in a logical structure

I added an alt attribute to each image in the HTML.

In the CSS, I moved the heading selectors to flow in a more logical structure. 

In the CSS, I condensed selectors that used the same property into one key/value pairing.

I changed the title of the website to "Horiseon-Home".
